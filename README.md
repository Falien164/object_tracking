# object-tracking
Engineering degree's project for thesis name: Project of moving-head camera object tracking system.

There are two parts of this project. First is a moving-head camera device and second is an user endpoint.

This git repository is about user endpoint that is graphical user interface. Main feature of this program is to receive image from camera device as well as detect and track objects using YOLO detector and SORT algorithm. It can also communicate with moving-head camera device by UART to rotate camera by specific angle.
